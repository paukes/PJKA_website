# using active-based learning

Teaching environmental science provides students with an {{< hl >}}interdisciplinary approach{{< /hl >}} to scientific inquiry. I want students to engage with the material, whether that be designing and implementing field-based projects or using open-access databases to form data-driven conclusions. These hands-on learning strategies work to deepen their engagement and connect different disciplines within environmental science.
