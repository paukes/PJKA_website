I really enjoy trying to understand how natural systems function, pairing hydrology with geochemical tools to unravel natural processes in the environment.

Ever since conducting field work in 2013 in the sub-arctic, I have been fascinated by the complexities and number of unknowns in Canada's North. Seeing the tight connection between land and community culture has further driven me to study these systems and see what a changing climate means for natural processes and the people connected to it.

My research interests can be summarized as:

I like to pair **field-based observations** with **geochemical and isotopic tools**, even conducting **laboratory experiments** to help identify what processes are driving carbon fate.

I fully believe research should be **transparent, open,** and be **easily communicated** to larger audiences. I really enjoy creatively visualizing and presenting data that engages audiences and generates excitement and understanding from our results.
