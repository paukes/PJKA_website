Prolific mining near Yellowknife resulted in a large amount of pollution deposited on surrounding land and surface waters. As part of Global Water Futures, the Sub-Arctic Metals Mobility Study [SAMMS](https://gwf.usask.ca/projects-facilities/all-projects/p1-samms.php), one aspect of the project focuses on how differences in dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and composition may be important for the mobility of legacy metals from the land to local surface waters.
