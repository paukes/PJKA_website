Thanks for the interest in my work! In short, I'm interested in how a changing climate influences carbon cycling in arctic and sub-arctic systems, and what that means for ecosystem health and drinking water quality. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Wilfrid Laurier University, working with [Dr. Jason Venkiteswaran](https://jjvenky.github.io/#jjvenky.github.io) and [Dr. Sherry Schiff](https://uwaterloo.ca/environmental-geochemistry/). We use field work and laboratory experiments to gain a better understanding of the processes that govern carbon fate.

When not in the field or lab, you can probably find me out and about in the mountains or woods with my toddler or cycling the rural roads nearby.
